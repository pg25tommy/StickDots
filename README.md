Copyright (C) VFS Class PG25, all rights reserved.

### Version: 3.15.9 
Last updated: 19/06/24

## Motivation
An exercise for VFS PG25 class to learn how to build a functional ship-ready mobile application, learning how to work collaboratively as a team to meet these goals.

---------------------------------------

## Stick Dots
This is a classic lines and boxes game where the goal of the game is to draw lines between the dots to capture a square. Should you capture a square, you get an extra turn.

---------------------------------------

## Features

### Game Play Mode
Allows players to engage in the strategic drawing of lines between dots on a grid. The objective is to complete squares to capture them. Whenever a player captures a square, they are awarded an extra turn, adding depth and strategy to each match.

### Leader Board
The Leader Board is a competitive feature that ranks players based on their performance in the game. Factors such as the number of games won, squares captured, and overall points contribute to a player's position on the leaderboard, fostering a competitive environment.

### User Profiles
User Profiles serve as a personal hub for each player. Here, players can track their game statistics, including wins, losses, and their highest scores. Profiles may also display badges or achievements earned through gameplay, providing a sense of progression and personalization.

### User Avatars
This feature allows players to customize their in-game presence with User Avatars. Players can choose from a variety of pre-designed avatars or customize their own to reflect their personality. Avatars are displayed during games and on leaderboards, adding a visual identity to each player.

### Multiplayer Lobby
The Multiplayer Lobby is where players gather to start games with others. It supports matchmaking with friends.

### AI Players
For those looking to practice or play solo, StickDots includes AI Players of varying difficulty levels. These computer-controlled opponents provide a challenging experience that can adapt to the player's skill level.
